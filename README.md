Practices and Principles to develop software

## Description
In order to develop better software, certian principles are followed for stronger and secure applications.  This is a curated list of accepted principles and practices for Selene Software, and any others who wish to follow, to follow when developing new software.

## General Principles
These are to be followed for all application development.

### SOLID Principles
* Single Responsibility Principle
  - An object should do just one thing, and do it well.
* Open/Closed Principle
  - A class should be open for extension, but closed for modification
* Liskov Substitution Principle
  - Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program
  - "If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, but runs on batteries, it's most likely not a duck."

  - Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface
* Dependency Inversion Principle
  - Depend upon Abstractions. Do not depend upon concretions.
